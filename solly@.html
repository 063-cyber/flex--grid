        In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. 
        The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand-tuned assembly language programs.
        It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.[citation needed]
        
        An early proposal for a high-level programming language was Plankalk√ºl,
         developed by Konrad Zuse for his Z1 computer between 1942 and 1945 but not implemented at the time.[7]
        
        The first functioning programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the early 1950s.
         John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer.
         [8] Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form.
          However, the program had to be interpreted into machine code every time it ran,
         making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.
        
        In the early 1950s, Alick Glennie developed Autocode, possibly the first compiled programming language,
         at the University of Manchester. In 1954, a second iteration of the language, known as the "Mark 1 Autocode", 
         was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker. Brooker, with the University of Manchester, 
         also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s.
          The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by Douglas Hartree of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961.
        Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimizations and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development,
         Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine.
        
        In 1954, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by a team led by John Backus; it was the first widely used high-level general purpose language to have a functional implementation, in contrast to only a design on paper.[9][10] When FORTRAN was first introduced,
         it was viewed with skepticism due to bugs, delays in development, and the comparative efficiency of "hand-coded" programs written in assembly.[11] However, in a hardware market that was rapidly evolving, the language eventually became known for its efficiency. It is still a popular language for high-performance computing[12] and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's TOP500 fastest supercomputers.[13]
        
        Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, named FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959.
         Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English language programming language and implemented a prototype.
         [14] The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.
         [15] Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in use at the time.[16]
